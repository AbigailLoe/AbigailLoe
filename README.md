Welcome to my website! 

My name is Abigail Loe, but if you are reading this, you probably already knew that. I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan, in the Department of Biostatistics. Before moving to Ann Arbor, I studied Math and Women's and Gender Studies at Carleton College (go Knights!).

My research sits at the intersection of survival analysis and machine learning. I work on new methods for recurrent and alternating recurrent evenets in healthcare, using the framework and tools of survival analysis to make sure that estimates are still valid. Check out my most recent paper, ["Random Forest for Dynamic Risk Prediction of Recurrent Events: A Pseudo-Observation Approach"](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxaf007)
